            <h3>How to contribute to an open s ource project</h3>
            <p>
              It's never been easy to learn programming. But despite tons of ways to learn how to code, we believe that the best way to improve your skills is by contributing to open source projects.

              The open source community provides a great opportunity for aspiring programmers to distinguish themselves; and by contributing to various projects, developers can improve their skills and get inspiration and support from like-minded people. But most importantly, they can prove that they can build fantastic experiences that people love.
              
              Previously, we have discussed what are open source projects and why open source is good for your business. In this article, we'll explain why you should contribute to such projects, how to contribute, and what projects to choose. This article is geared towards developers who are just starting their career and would like to get involved with the community (and maybe become a coding genius).

                5 things that can help you manage your time if you are a
                busy-person
              </h3>
              <p>
                Time management is something that most people want to improve on - especially at work. A survey by salary.com found 89% of the respondents admitted to wasting time every day at their job. With cell phones, social media, and the frequent emails distracting us, being successful at time management is progressively harder to achieve. However, utilize these 6 tips, and you’re on your way to fewer distractions and more productivity at work.

                1. Set reminders for all your tasks
                
                The key to time management success is to know your deadlines and set reminders. We suggest setting a reminder 15 minutes before a meeting or event so you can prepare and gather your things.
                
                2. Create a daily planner
                
                Make a list of the tasks that you need to accomplish that day, and note in upcoming meetings or deadlines as you become aware of them. As you complete your list, make sure to tick off the tasks you have completed.
                
                3. Give each task a time limit
                
                On your daily list of things to do, pen in how much time you think each task will take you. If you don’t finish, stop when the time you allotted ends, and come back to it later. Sometimes moving on to different responsibilities and then coming back gives your mind a fresh start and a new perspective.
                
                4. Block out distractions
                
                First and foremost, turn off your email notification. Set 30-minute blocks to check your email every couple hours instead of checking it every 15 minutes. Make sure you minimize non-work distractions such as your cell phone, social media, or your favorite online store.
                
                5. Establish routine
                
                While at work, create a routine that makes the most sense for your position. Why is this important? For starters, if a chaotic day comes along, you’ll still work through the issue while adhering to your routine. By sticking to your routine, you won’t be able to procrastinate. Most importantly, your mental health and stress levels with thank you.

              <h3>10 ways to bid for salary-raise through email</h3>
              <p>
                In this article, we’re going to cover how to ask for a raise when you are underpaid (or when you just want a higher salary), with examples and sample scripts you can follow. 

We’ll also look at when to ask, because that’s equally important. (While there’s no exact best time to ask for a raise, but there are some very important “Rules” you should follow before you go ask).

Let’s get started…

How to Ask for a Raise: Script and Steps to Follow
1. Set up a time to ask for your pay raise
Asking for a pay increase is an important discussion and deserves its own meeting. So rule #1 is don’t try to bring up the discussion at the end of another meeting, a weekly check-in, etc.

              <h3>How to become a Full-Stack developer in 8months</h3>
              <p>
                So you’re considering learning web development skills and you’ve heard that becoming a full stack developer is the way to go. That’s very savvy, considering full stack developers have both the front end and back end development skills most tech teams need to build web applications. The question is: how to become a full stack developer?

Becoming a full stack developer means being well-versed in back end processes — like working with databases, such as MongoDB (part of the MERN technology stack) and MySQL, using open-source server environments like Node.js, calling APIs, and other server-side functionalities — as well as front end languages and libraries, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and its frameworks and libraries, including Angular and React.

A software developer with both front end and back end development know-how can apply for software engineering jobs and web development jobs alike — or land a gig doing full stack web development.
